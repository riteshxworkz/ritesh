    6)      Method parameter in java: 
                            variables defined in the method declaration after the method name, inside the parentheses. 
							This includes primitive types such as int, float, boolean, etc, and 
							non-primitive or object types such as an array, String, etc. 
							You can pass values(Argument) to the method parameters, at the method call
                                   
                       


     7)            Compile-time polymorphism is achieved through method overloading. Method Overloading says you can have more than one function with the same name in 
              one class having a different prototype.       
                    Example 
					       The first add method takes two arguments (a and b), and it returns the sum of the two numbers added together. 
						   In contrast, the second add method takes three arguments (a, b, and c), 
						   and it returns the sum of the three numbers added together
          
               public class MethodOverloading {
	
	           // 1 parameter
	             void show(int num1)
	               {
		     System.out.println("number 1 : " + num1);
	                   }

	                // 2 parameter
	             void show(int num1, int num2)
	              {
		     System.out.println("number 1 : " + num1
						+ " number 2 : " + num2);
	                 }

	                 public static void main(String[] args)
                  	{
		         MethodOverloading obj = new MethodOverloading();
	
		            // 1st show function
		          obj.show(3);
	
		           // 2nd show function
		                     obj.show(4, 5);
                         	}
                             }






   8)        Varargs is a short name for variable arguments. .
                In Java, an argument of a method can accept arbitrary number of values. 
				This argument that can accept variable number of values is called varargs. 
				The syntax for implementing varargs is as follows: accessModifier methodName(datatypeâ€¦ arg) { // method body }
			

   9)    Package is used to put all our related classes into one specified Folder for a better understanding 
	          whereas import is used to import(get) the needed or the dependent classes to run our application/class.  

         Types of import are 
           1)single type import 
           2)on-demand type input
		   
	    1.Single Type Import: "import type_name;" - It tells JVM to load the definition of a single type immediately from the specified package.

        2. On-Demand Type Import: "import package_name.*;" - It tells JVM to search the specified package for any missing type when it is needed.

   10)     Constructor chaining ;
                           Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object. 
						   
						    Constructor chaining can be done in two ways:
                1) within same class 							
                2)from base class

            1)Within same class: It can be done using this() keyword for constructors in the same class
            2)From base class: by using super() keyword to call the constructor from the base class.
               
			   
			   
			   
			   Example program
			   " Java program to illustrate Constructor Chaining  within same class Using this() keyword "
class Temp
{
	Temp()
	{
		this(5);
		System.out.println("The Default constructor");
	}

	Temp(int x)
	{
		this(5, 15);
		System.out.println(x);
	}

	Temp(int x, int y)
	{
		System.out.println(x * y);
	}

	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		new Temp();
	}
}




   11)       fibonacci sequence using recursion
                               
	static void Fibonacci(int N)
	{
		int num1 = 0, num2 = 1;

		int counter = 0;
		{
			System.out.print(num1 + " ");

			// Swap
			int num3 = num2 + num1;
			num1 = num2;
			num2 = num3;
			counter = counter + 1;
		}
	}

	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		int N = 10;

		Fibonacci(N);
	}
}


   12) how we check if a list of intergers contains only add numbers in java 
                                        the traverse through the list once and check whether each integer is completely divided by two or not. 

   13)   java program that checks if two arrays contains same elements

import java.util.Arrays;

public class CheckArraysEqual {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		// Initializing the first array
		int a[] = { 30, 25, 40 };

		// Initializing the second array
		int b[] = { 30, 25, 40 };
		boolean result = Arrays.equals(a, b);

		if (result == true) {
			// Print the result
			System.out.println("Two arrays are equal");
		}
		else {
			System.out.println("Two arrays are not equal");
		}
	}
}








    14)           An enumeration (enum for short) in Java is a special data type which contains a set of predefined constants. 
	                 we use an enum when dealing with values that aren't required to change, like days of the week, seasons of the year, colors, 
	
	
	
	15)          happening inside jvm when you create an object ?
	                     "When an object from the MyObject class is created for the first time, the JVM searches the file system for the definition of the class,"

	
	
	16)       Members declared in the class, along with all members (except constructors and finalizers) 
	             declared in all classes in its inheritance hierarchy.
				 
	              The 16 Types of JAVA Members
			         Given a class in java containing public,private & protected fields. Get/list/print all fields of class using class Class. 
					 getDeclaredFields() of Class to retrieve all data members.
